"""Scrollable strip, the way niri tiles.

Windows sit in columns on a strip that is wider than the display. The
display is a viewport onto it: focusing a window scrolls the strip until its
column is fully in view. A column that overlaps the viewport is shown at its
place on the strip, cut at the edge if it does not fit, so a neighbour of a
column wider than half stays partly in sight. The ones wholly beyond the
edges are parked there with a sliver peeking in, enough to reach with the
focus command. Nothing is ever squeezed to fit; a new column keeps its width
and the strip gets longer.

Commands the layout answers (mimi gives them no meaning; this file does):

  mimi tiling cmd focus <left|right>    focus the next column that way,
                                        scrolling to it; up/down within one
  mimi tiling cmd move <left|right>     move the focused column along the strip;
                                        up/down swaps the window within one
  mimi tiling cmd consume                pull the focused window into the column
                                         on its left, as another row
  mimi tiling cmd expel                  push the focused window out into a
                                         column of its own, to the right
  mimi tiling cmd width [fraction|prev|+d|-d]
                                        cycle the focused column through a
                                        third, a half, two thirds (prev goes
                                        back); set a fraction; or nudge it by
                                        d, as niri's +10%
  mimi tiling cmd center                 scroll the focused column to the middle
  mimi tiling cmd togglefloat            take the focused window off the strip
                                        and leave it where it is, or put it
                                        back in a column of its own
  mimi tiling cmd scroll <left|right> [fraction]
                                        scroll the strip a step that way, a
                                        quarter of the display unless given
  mimi tiling cmd togglemax              fill the display with the focused
                                         window, for now
  mimi tiling cmd togglestack            make the focused column hold its
                                         windows in one place rather than as
                                         rows, so only the focused one is
                                         seen, and back again

PRIORITY, at the top of the file, lists bundle identifiers whose windows
open at a fixed place on the strip, each in a column of its own beside the
app's others. Anything else opens right of the focused column.

A column holds its windows as rows by default, each with a share of the
height. togglestack makes it hold them in one place instead, the way niri
tabs a column: every window fills the column and only the focused one is
seen. With [tiling.stackbar] enabled mimi draws the others as cards behind
it, which is the only thing that says how many are in there. focus
up and down still move between them, and move up and down still reorder
them.

With tiling.relayout_on_drag set, dragging a column's edge sets its width,
and dropping a window on another column moves it into that column. A window
sharing a column, dropped on empty strip or in the outer quarter of its own
column, gets a column of its own on that side. Dropped higher or lower in a
column of rows, it takes that row. A tabbed column has no rows, so it stays
where it is. Use the
focus command rather than mimi action focus_window --left/--right: the
parked columns all sit at the edge, so spatial focus cannot tell them apart.

A layout program: reads the tiling input on stdin, prints the output on
stdout. Copy, edit, own. Standard library only.
