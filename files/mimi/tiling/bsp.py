"""Dwindle BSP, the way Hyprland tiles by default.

Every window is a leaf of a binary tree. A new window splits the focused
window's area in two, side by side when that area is wider than tall and one
above the other otherwise. Closing a window hands its area back to its
sibling. The tree lives in the state mimi keeps for the space, so nothing
here touches a file.

A leaf can hold more than one window, as yabai stacks. They share the whole
area, so only the focused one is seen, and with [tiling.stackbar] enabled mimi
draws the rest as cards behind it. stack moves a window into its
neighbour that way, unstack gives it an area of its own again, and next and
prev move round the windows sharing one. A swap or a drag moves a whole leaf,
so a stack travels together.

Commands the layout answers (mimi gives them no meaning; this file does):

  mimi tiling cmd swap <left|right|up|down>   swap with the neighbour that way
  mimi tiling cmd togglesplit                 flip the focused window's split

                                              window's share of its split
  mimi tiling cmd togglefloat                 take the focused window out of the
                                              tree, or put it back
  mimi tiling cmd togglemax                   fill the area with the focused
                                              window, for now
  mimi tiling cmd stack <left|right|up|down>  move the focused window into the
                                              neighbour that way, sharing its
                                              area rather than splitting it
  mimi tiling cmd unstack                     give the focused window an area
                                              of its own again
  mimi tiling cmd next / prev                 move round the windows sharing
                                              one area
  mimi tiling cmd focus <left|right|up|down>  focus the neighbour that way,
                                              landing on the window it is
                                              showing when it holds several

With tiling.relayout_on_drag set, dragging any edge of any window resizes the
split that edge belongs to, and the rest of the tree follows; dragging a
window and dropping it on another swaps the two, as Hyprland does.

stdout. Copy, edit, own. Standard library only.
