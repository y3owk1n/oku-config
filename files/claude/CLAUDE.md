## Writing

- ASCII punctuation only. No em dash, en dash, `--`,
  semicolon, or colon joining two clauses. Use a comma,
  or write two sentences.
- Hyphens are fine inside words, filenames, and flags.
  A colon introducing a list or following a label is
  fine.

## Approach

- Read files once. Re-read only when changed.
- Write tight code: direct, minimal, one purpose per abstraction.
- Solve only what was asked. Change only what's needed.
- Verify APIs, versions, flags, and package names from source.
- Surface errors with full context.
- Code first, explanation after only when non-obvious.

## Review

- One pass: state the bug, show the fix, stop.
- Standards axis: conventions, naming, structure,
  types, error handling, security. Cite the repo
  rule you apply, not a general preference.
- Spec axis: does the diff do what the spec says and
  no more. Missing criteria, wrong behaviour, scope
  creep. Skip this axis when there is no spec.
- Rank by cost of being wrong. Skip nits.

## Workflow

- Test after writing. Fix before moving on.
- Verify output matches expected format.
- Run the code before declaring done.
- Test only what the project promises: a behaviour
  listed in prd/behaviours.md, or a public boundary
  (CLI, exported API, route, persisted schema).
- Never assert the toolchain works. No install, build,
  compile, lint, file-exists, or config-parses tests.
- Never mirror implementation. Test through public
  interfaces. Mock at system boundaries only.

## Search Protocol

- Public URLs -> ctx_fetch_and_index(url), then ctx_search.
- Inline WebFetch only for private/authenticated URLs.

## Subagents

Use **quick** for high-volume trivial work: file reads,
git/gh commands, grep, one-line edits. Dispatch when
the task is a single command with no reasoning needed.
